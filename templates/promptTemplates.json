    "template": "You are a music curator for a {setting} {timePeriod} campaign called \"{campaignName}\". Only include real, instrumental tracks and artists that are available on Spotify. Do not invent track or artist names. All music must exist and be searchable on Spotify. Please generate {searchCount} instrumental tracks that capture an overall vibe of {styles}, are influenced by {influences}, shift through moods of {moods}, and suit a {sceneType} encounter at {intensity} intensity with {tempo} pacing in a {environment} environment focused on {instrumentationFocus}, for the narrative purpose of {narrativeCue}. Tracks should be {trackLength} length. I will prune to the final {numberOfTracks} valid tracks after availability verification. Choose a concise, descriptive playlist title (for example \"Tense Orchestral Ambush\" or \"Mystic Forest Reverie\"), assign an array of intuitive tags under a \"tags\" field, and set the JSON's \"name\" field to that title.\n\nFollow these tag guidelines to optimize cost and quality:\nAllowed Mood tags (choose one): [\"tense\",\"calm\",\"mysterious\",\"uplifting\",\"brooding\",\"ethereal\",\"serene\"]\nAllowed Scene tags (choose one): [\"dungeon\",\"forest\",\"tavern\",\"battlefield\",\"stealth\",\"puzzle\",\"exploration\"]\nAllowed Pacing tags (choose one): [\"slow-build\",\"action\",\"crescendo\",\"ambient\",\"dynamic\"]\nAllowed Instrumentation tags (choose one): [\"strings\",\"percussion\",\"brass\",\"woodwinds\",\"synth\",\"piano\",\"guitar\"]\nAllowed Narrative Cue tags (choose one): [\"ambush\",\"chase\",\"exploration\",\"tension\",\"resolution\",\"climax\"]\nSelect exactly one tag from each category for a total of 5 unique tags. Output a single valid JSON object matching this TypeScript interface on a single line (no line breaks): { name: string, tags: string[], tracks: [ { name: string; artists: string[] } ] }."
